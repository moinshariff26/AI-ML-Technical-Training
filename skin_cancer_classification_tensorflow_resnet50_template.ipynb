    "# Skin Cancer Classification using Transfer Learning with TensorFlow\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use transfer learning with a pretrained ResNet50 model in TensorFlow to classify different types of skin lesions from the HAM10000 dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives:\n",
    "- Understand the concept of transfer learning and fine-tuning\n",
    "- Learn how to preprocess and augment medical image data\n",
    "- Build and train a deep learning model using TensorFlow\n",
    "- Evaluate model performance using relevant metrics\n",
    "- Visualize results and interpret model predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background:\n",
    "Skin cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide. Early detection is crucial for effective treatment. Deep learning models can assist dermatologists by automating the classification of skin lesions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset:\n",
    "The HAM10000 dataset contains dermatoscopic images of seven types of skin lesions:\n",
    "- Melanocytic nevi (nv)\n",
    "- Melanoma (mel)\n",
    "- Benign keratosis (bkl)\n",
    "- Basal cell carcinoma (bcc)\n",
    "- Actinic keratoses (akiec)\n",
    "- Vascular lesions (vas)\n",
    "- Dermatofibroma (df)\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Transfer Learning?\n",
    "Transfer learning leverages a pretrained model on a large dataset (e.g., ImageNet) and adapts it to a new task, which is especially useful when the new dataset is small or specialized.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why TensorFlow?\n",
    "TensorFlow is a popular deep learning framework with strong support for production deployment and a rich ecosystem.\n"
